s390: Reimplements all the functions and does not use asm-genirc/hugetlb.h, so I don't touch.
prepare_hugepage_range:	
  -> mips  does tests that might be useful for others or superfluous ?!
  -> parisc, s390, sh do not use file
							
inline functions already defined in asm-generic/hugetlb.h are NOT used
int arch hugetlb.h => putting the include at the end of the file will not
give rise to any missing function declarations

Linux kernel
============

This file was moved to Documentation/admin-guide/README.rst

Please notice that there are several guides for kernel developers and users.
These guides can be rendered in a number of formats, like HTML and PDF.

In order to build the documentation, use ``make htmldocs`` or
``make pdfdocs``.

There are various text files in the Documentation/ subdirectory,
several of them using the Restructured Text markup notation.
See Documentation/00-INDEX for a list of what is contained in each file.

Please read the Documentation/process/changes.rst file, as it contains the
requirements for building and running the kernel, and information about
the problems which may result by upgrading your kernel.
