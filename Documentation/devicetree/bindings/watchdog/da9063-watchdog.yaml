description: |
  This module is part of the DA9063 MFD device. For more details, see
  Documentation/devicetree/bindings/mfd/da9063.yaml.

  The watchdog controller is represented as a sub-node of the PMIC node
  on the device tree.

  This node defines settings for the Watchdog timer associated
  with the DA9063 and DA9063L. There are currently no entries in this
  binding, however compatible = "dlg,da9063-watchdog" should be added
  if a node is created.
