description:
  This module is part of the DA9063 MFD device. For more details, see
  Documentation/devicetree/bindings/mfd/da9063.yaml.

  The RTC controller is represented as a sub-node of the PMIC node
  on the device tree.

  This node defines settings for the Real-Time Clock associated with
  the DA9063 only. The RTC is not present in DA9063L. There are currently
  no entries in this binding, however compatible = "dlg,da9063-rtc" should
  be added if a node is created.
