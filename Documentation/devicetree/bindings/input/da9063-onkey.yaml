  The OnKey controller is represented as a sub-node of the PMIC node
  on the device tree.

  This node defines the OnKey settings for controlling the key
  functionality of the device. The node should contain the compatible property
  with the value "dlg,da9063-onkey".

properties:

    description: |
      Disable power-down using a long key-press. If this
      entry exists the OnKey driver will remove support for the KEY_POWER key
      press. If this entry does not exist then by default the key-press
      triggered power down is enabled and the OnKey will support both KEY_POWER
      and KEY_SLEEP.
