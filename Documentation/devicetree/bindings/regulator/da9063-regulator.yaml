description: |
  This module is part of the DA9063 MFD device. For more details, see
  Documentation/devicetree/bindings/mfd/da9063.yaml.

  The regulator controller is represented as a sub-node of the PMIC node
  on the device tree.

  This node defines the settings for the LDOs and BUCKs.
  The DA9063(L) regulators are bound using their names listed below:

  bcore1    : BUCK CORE1
  bcore2    : BUCK CORE2
  bpro      : BUCK PRO
  bmem      : BUCK MEM
  bio       : BUCK IO
  bperi     : BUCK PERI
  ldo1      : LDO_1	(DA9063 only)
  ldo2      : LDO_2	(DA9063 only)
  ldo3      : LDO_3
  ldo4      : LDO_4	(DA9063 only)
  ldo5      : LDO_5	(DA9063 only)
  ldo6      : LDO_6	(DA9063 only)
  ldo7      : LDO_7
  ldo8      : LDO_8
  ldo9      : LDO_9
  ldo10     : LDO_10	(DA9063 only)
  ldo11     : LDO_11

  The component follows the standard regulator framework and the bindings
  details of individual regulator device can be found in:
