- Make ARCH_WANT_DEFAULT_TOPDOWN_MMAP_LAYOUT select ARCH_HAS_ELF_RANDOMIZE
  by default
- x86 use of the generic functions adds 8/9 commits to the series in order
  to make it simple to review, if Kees does not mind, I'll propose another
  series only for x86.
- There is no common API to determine if a process is 32b, so I came up with
  !IS_ENABLED(CONFIG_64BIT) || is_compat_task() in [PATCH v4 12/14].
- Mention in the change log that x86 already takes care of not offseting mmap
  base address if the task does not want randomization.
- Re-introduce a comment that should not have been removed.
- Add Reviewed/Acked-By from Paul, Christoph and Kees, thank you for that.
- I tried to minimize the changes from the commits in v3 in order to make
  easier the review of the v4, the commits changed or added are:
  - [PATCH v4 5/14] arm64, mm: Make randomization selected by generic topdown mmap layout
  - [PATCH v4 8/14] arm: Use generic mmap top-down layout and brk randomization 
  - [PATCH v4 11/14] mips: Adjust brk randomization offset to fit generic version
  - [PATCH v4 12/14] mips: Replace arch specific way to determine 32B task with generic version
  - [PATCH v4 13/14] mips: Use generic mmap top-down layout and brk randomization

First patch needs to swap Reviewedby/ackedby

=> Totally wrong, I override ALL arches arch_randomize_brk/arch_mmap_rnd
   but I really don't know how to do because arm/mips can select ELF_RANDOMIZE
   when no MMU and then they lose their definition of those functions...
