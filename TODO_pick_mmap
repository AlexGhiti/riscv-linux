mmap_is_legacy: arm, arm64, mips, powerpc, s390
mmap_base (simple without pad): arm, mips, (s390 to check)
arch_pick_mmap_layout: arm, arm64, mips, s390 (depends on arch_mmap_rnd)
arch_mmap_rnd: arm, arm64 (CONFIG_COMPAT), mips (CONFIG_COMPAT), 

TODO: - arch_mmap_rnd, to merge arm64 and mips, check if TIF_32BIT is equivalent to TASK_IS_32BIT_ADDR(maybe define and use is_32bit_task() already defined in parisc. powerpc already uses it in arch_mmap_rnd !) 
DONE: arm, arm64 and mips

===> States clearly that it did not even bother with other architectures: this is wrong, and his patch must be applied to other arches that do randomization, otherwise the same problem appears on those too ! So the good solution is to add 

-       unsigned long pad = (STACK_RND_MASK << PAGE_SHIFT) + stack_guard_gap;
-
-       /* Values close to RLIM_INFINITY can overflow. */
-       if (gap + pad > gap)
-               gap += pad;

in all arches before moving this function to generic.
